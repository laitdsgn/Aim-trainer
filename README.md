# Aim-trainer
 
Aim trainer is a game where you have to click the circles appearing in the game container. 
The game calculates your Hits, Misses, and Accuracy of your clicks.
Player has 1 minute to hit all the circles appearing, but there are some difficulties...
Size of every circle is random (width, and height of 20-60 px), and every second the circles appear a bit faster, 
making it harder to click all of them.
